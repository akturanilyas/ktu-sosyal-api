-I created groups and relations of the groups, groups have many to many relations with users, and
one to many relations with posts, so a user can have their own posts, and groups can have their own posts
I am not exactly sure if this is the right way to do it, but this is the only this that came to my mind

-I need to complete the CRUD actions of groups, right now you can only create groups, I need to edit the create
function of posts in order to insert posts into groups, but, how will I know which user posted the post? I'm not going to
get it from the URL, but get it from the jwt since the user has to be signed in to create a post anyway.
so, when creating a post, the post should be filled like this:

CONTENT: "example content"
USER: "the userId you will get from the jwt"
GROUP: "if not null, then you will get from params"

something like this i don't really know I have never done this before
